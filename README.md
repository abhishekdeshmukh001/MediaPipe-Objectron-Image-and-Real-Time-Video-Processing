## Title: Mediopipe Objectron Image and Real Time Video Processing


## Project 1: Objectron Image Processing

### - Overview:
* This project utilizes the Objectron model from MediaPipe to process a static image containing a cup.
* The script fetches an image from a URL, converts it to an array, and then applies the Objectron model to detect and annotate cup landmarks. 
* The resulting image is displayed with 2D landmarks and a 3D axis based on rotation and translation.

### Ouput:

## Project 2: Objectron Real-Time Video Processing

### - Overview:
* This project demonstrates real-time object detection and annotation using the Objectron model from MediaPipe on a video stream. 
* The script captures video from a specified file, resizes each frame, and applies the Objectron model to detect and annotate cups. 
* The processed frames are displayed with 2D landmarks and a 3D axis in real-time.
